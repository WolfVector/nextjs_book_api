![Image](book_cap.PNG)

This project was one of the first ones I did in Nextjs. The goal of the page is simple: search books using the Google Books API.

**Note**: Unfortunately the Google servers in charge of handling this API fails frequently.

## Technologies used

- **Nextjs**: 
- **React**: 
- **Tailwind**: 
- **Google Books API**:
